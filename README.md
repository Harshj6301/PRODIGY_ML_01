# Linear Regression model for estimating house prices
---
### PRODIGY_ML_01

### Workflow

- The datapreprocessing demonstrates how to load and preprocess the dataset. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

- The feature engineering covers the process of feature engineering. It involves creating new features, transforming existing ones, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

- The modeling showcases building and training machine learning models. Linear Regression and CatBoost Regressor are used in this project for predicting house prices.

- The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Visualizations are also provided to compare actual and predicted values.
